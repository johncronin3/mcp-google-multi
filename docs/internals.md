# Implementation notes

Contributor-facing rationale for non-obvious implementation choices — why the code is the way it is, not how to use it. Back to the [README](../README.md).

## Token store

### Windows rename retry (`renameWithRetry`, `src/token-store.ts`)

`renameWithRetry` exists because Windows uses classic rename semantics (`MoveFileExW` without POSIX semantics): replacing a token file that another process momentarily holds open — a concurrent `readToken`, an antivirus scanner, or a search indexer — fails with a transient `EPERM`, `EACCES`, or `EBUSY`. Reads deliberately take no lock, so the token write lock cannot prevent this collision; a short bounded retry (`RENAME_ATTEMPTS` with linear backoff) absorbs it instead. POSIX rename never fails this way, so the retry loop is effectively inert on Linux and macOS.

### Desk remint → Secret Manager (`src/token-secret.ts`)

Hosted Cloud Run mounts per-alias secrets named `google-mcp-token-<alias>` (e.g. `google-mcp-token-stromback`) and copies `*.enc` from `/mnt/tok-*` at boot (`docker/entrypoint.sh`). A desk remint that only writes the local `*.enc` leaves Cloud Run on the previous refresh; Google then revokes that refresh (`invalid_grant`) while Olga/other aliases stay green.

When `--upload-sm` / `GOOGLE_UPLOAD_SM` is on, `writeTokenAndUploadSm` snapshots prior desk bytes, writes the new envelope, then `addSecretVersion`. SM failure reverts the desk file to those prior bytes when a prior file existed — remint must not count as done if Secret Manager did not bump. Project is explicit (`--project` / `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` / `GCP_PROJECT`); never `gcloud config get-value project`. The writer uploads encrypted `*.enc` bytes only (never decrypts, never logs payload / MASTER_KEY). Adding a secret version does not remount Cloud Run — Bulkhead remount is a separate operator step.

### Hosted refresh persist (`persistRotatedTokenUpdates`, `src/token-secret.ts`)

Google token rotation on Cloud Run used to call `updateToken` → `writeFileSync` on `/tmp/google-tokens` (copied from `/mnt/tok-*` at boot). A local write is not Secret Manager. Refresh must not succeed by writing `/mnt` or a desk path.

`getClient` wraps `refreshTokenNoCache` so persist is awaited before the client keeps rotated credentials. Call order: shape check → encrypt v1 envelope → in-memory upsert → fail-closed `addSecretVersion` of `google-mcp-token-<alias>` (explicit GCP project; never a silent ADC default) → overlay. Hosted never writes TOKEN_STORE_PATH. Desk/stdio may write `*.enc` after SM success. SM failure does not adopt overlay and does not write disk.

Interim operator pin if a comment must name a project: `myflow-260730`.

## Admin SDK

### Why admin tools are per-account opt-in (`ADMIN_SCOPES`, `src/auth.ts`)

The Admin SDK requires a Workspace account with admin privileges; consumer @gmail.com accounts always get a 403. Strictly speaking, the only person with admin rights over a @gmail.com account is a Corporate Operations Engineer on Google's internal Techstop helpdesk — and if that's you, an MCP server is really not how you should be doing this. Requesting admin scopes on an account that cannot use them would only add consent-screen noise, so `GOOGLE_ADMIN_ACCOUNTS` grants them per-account instead of globally.

## Networking

### Why the server raises Node's happy-eyeballs timeout (`applyNetTuning`, `src/net-tuning.ts`)

Node enables Happy Eyeballs (`autoSelectFamily`) by default since v20 and gives each address-family connect attempt 250ms (`autoSelectFamilyAttemptTimeout`). On a high-latency link to a distant Google edge, or when the ISP router advertises a dead IPv6 route, that budget aborts the IPv6 attempt *and* the IPv4 attempt, so every Google call fails with `ETIMEDOUT` while `curl` (which waits normally) works. Node itself raised the default to 500ms ([nodejs/node#60334](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/60334)) but only from v25.2; every LTS line this package supports ships 250ms, and the real fix (RFC 8305 parallel attempts, [nodejs/node#48145](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/48145)) is still open. The server therefore raises the process-wide default to 2000ms at startup. The trade-off is a slower failover when one address family hangs rather than fails fast — acceptable for a personal MCP server, not worth per-request agent plumbing through gaxios and undici. The tuning is skipped whenever the user passes `--network-family-autoselection-attempt-timeout` or `--no-network-family-autoselection` (via CLI or `NODE_OPTIONS`), and it never lowers a value that is already at or above 2000ms.

### How the section-6 API-enablement probe picks its reads (`API_PROBES`, `src/api-probe.ts`)

Probes are selected by the **granted scopes** on the probed account, not by the registered services: probing an ungranted service can only produce `insufficient_scope`, which says nothing about enablement. Services with no no-argument read (Sheets, Docs, Forms) are probed with a GET on a nonexistent id — Google checks `accessNotConfigured`/`SERVICE_DISABLED` before routing, so a 404 still proves the API is enabled. Admin SDK is deliberately unprobed (role-dependent: a 403 on a non-admin account is ambiguous). A connect-level failure aborts the run so section 6 reports one WARN with the syscall code instead of a column of unknowns. The probe uses `getClient`, so an expired-refreshable token may refresh and re-encrypt on disk — the same cache write every tool call performs; BR7's "no mutation" bars config/token *destruction*, not the refresh path.

On this house isolate, `doctor` calls the probe. Live `DEFAULT_DEPS` still go through `getClient`, which is grant-gated (`assertAccountAllowed`). Hosted refresh persist writes Secret Manager, not the local mount.
### Why connect failures get their own `network_error` envelope (`netCodeOf`, `src/tools/_errors.ts`)

The Google API path is gaxios → node-fetch → `node:https`. When the happy-eyeballs `AggregateError` (whose `message` is empty) reaches node-fetch, its `FetchError` keeps only the `code`/`syscall` and discards the error object, producing the famously unhelpful `request to <url> failed, reason: ` with the real signal hiding in `error.code`. `mapGoogleError` previously fed `error.code` through `Number()` (built for HTTP statuses), so `ETIMEDOUT` was dropped and the envelope said `upstream_error, retriable: false` — wrong on both counts. `netCodeOf` walks the cause chain (GaxiosError → FetchError; undici `TypeError` → `AggregateError.errors`) for known connect/DNS syscall codes and returns a `network_error` envelope that names the code, marks transient codes retriable, and points at the happy-eyeballs flag. Per-address sub-errors are only available on undici call sites; node-fetch destroys them upstream.

## Session grants

### Why `/mcp` rejects JWTs missing `gname` at the HTTP gate (`jwtAccessGrantGate`, `src/session-grant.ts`)

`runWithGrant(null)` used to let `initialize` and `tools/list` succeed, then fail inside the first alias-scoped tool. On Grok that looks like a flaky tool, not a missing authorize-time grant. When enforcement is on and the Bearer is a layer-2 access JWT, missing/unknown `gname` is HTTP 403 at `/mcp` before `handleMcp`. Static `MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` (CLI/Hermes) is unchanged — those sessions still use in-process `set_grant`. Codes never go in the JWT; replicas restore via `resolveGrantByName` + ALS.

### Why hosted `set_grant` is refused (`hostedSetGrantRefusal`)

`setSessionGrant` writes process memory. Cloud Run has no sticky sessions, so a successful `set_grant` on replica A is invisible on replica B. Agents treat that `ok` as durable. Hosted (`isHostedHttp`: `MCP_HOSTED` / `K_SERVICE`) refuses the tool and points at `/oauth/authorize`. `set_grant` is CUD-overridden to `read` so the default `read-only` profile does not hide that message behind `write_disabled` (`set` otherwise infers `update`). `docker/entrypoint.sh` already exports `GOOGLE_GRANTS_PATH` from `/mnt/grants/grants.json` when unset — no second bake.

## Executor

### Request bodies on GET/HEAD (`resolveRequestBody`, `src/executor.ts`)

`executeApiMethod` strips request bodies from GET/HEAD requests before dispatch:

- gaxios stringifies any object passed as `data` without checking the HTTP verb, and undici (Node's `fetch`) rejects GET/HEAD requests that carry a body (`Request with GET/HEAD method cannot have body`). A caller-supplied `{}` body on a read tool would therefore crash the request.
- Stripping is lossless: no Google Discovery GET/HEAD method declares a request schema, so there is never a legitimate GET/HEAD body to preserve.
- Write verbs keep the usual semantics: `null`/`undefined` means no body is sent.

## Argument normalization

`src/arg-normalize.ts` renames snake_case `tools/call` argument keys to their declared camelCase twins (e.g. `thread_id` → `threadId`) before SDK validation, at the transport `onmessage` seam. The seam is deliberate: the SDK advertises an EMPTY input schema in `tools/list` for any non-object schema wrapper (pipe/preprocess), so schema-level normalization would blank every tool's advertised parameters, while the JSON-RPC message shape is versioned MCP spec. The rename is lossless by construction (sent key unknown to the schema, camel twin declared, twin not also sent) and each one logs key names — never values — to stderr. Because clients string-encode values for keys absent from the advertised schema, a renamed key's value is also coerced to the declared scalar kind when it parses cleanly (`"2"` → `2` for a number field, `"true"` → `true` for a boolean); declared keys' values are never touched. `GOOGLE_ARG_NORMALIZE=off` disables it.

The same seam has a second job: **unknown-argument screening** (`src/arg-strict.ts`, `GOOGLE_ARG_UNKNOWN`). zod strips undeclared keys before a handler runs, so a misremembered parameter name used to produce a *successful* call with wrong behavior: `parentId` passed to `drive_create_folder` (which declares `parentFolderId`) was dropped and the folder was created in My Drive root. Because the seam already holds the tool's declared key set, it can see exactly what the schema is about to discard. It never rewrites a key and never touches a value: rewriting on a guess would send a real value to Google, which is worse than refusing. Renaming runs first, so a snake_case twin of a declared key is a fix rather than an unknown argument. Suggestions are tiered (case/separator-insensitive equality, then token subset, then containment, then edit distance) because plain edit distance cannot reach the motivating case: `parentid` to `parentfolderid` is distance 6. When nothing matches, the hint names how sibling tools in the same service spell the concept. The default is `reject`: `warn` shipped first as pure observability, but it reaches stderr only, so the client still sees a confident success for a call the server did not perform. Never screened: keys starting with `_` (MCP and vendor metadata), keys containing `/` (namespaced extensions), the four client-artifact names (`random_string`, the probe some clients send to a tool they read as argument-less, plus `toolCallId`/`tool_call_id`/`tool_call_description`, which bridges have been seen folding into `arguments` instead of `params._meta` where the spec puts them), tools declaring no arguments, and a key whose declared twin the same call also sent (that call already behaves correctly, so it is left alone). A sibling-spelling hint only ever names a tool that is currently advertised in `tools/list`, since naming a hidden one turns a recoverable error into a dead end. Dotted keys are deliberately *not* exempt, since 41 declared parameters genuinely contain a dot. The escape hatch needs no exemption either: its open-endedness lives in the *values* of `queryParams`/`body`, never in its fixed top-level keys.

The seam also owns one **outbound** job (`withValidationEnvelope`). The SDK validates tool input itself, throws, and catches its own throw in the same `tools/call` handler, returning `{content:[{type:'text',text:<prose>}],isError:true}`. No handler of ours runs, so no envelope exists and the client used to get free text with no slug, no hint and no `retriable`, which is precisely the contract break the hint floor exists to prevent. The wrapper converts that frame, and only that frame: a handler's own answer, whether JSON or the account wizard's prose, passes through untouched, because only the SDK's two prefixes (`Input validation error:`, `Output validation error:`) are rewritten. It is wrapped **innermost**, below the metrics tap, because outbound runs outermost-first: the tap must still see the original prose to classify it as `schema_validation`, while the client sees the envelope. The account is recovered from the pending request, since the registry injects the default only after validation has already failed.
