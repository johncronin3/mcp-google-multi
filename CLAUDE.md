# Working on mcp-google-multi

Conventions for AI assistants modifying this codebase. v5 is **local, stdio, user-OAuth only**. User-facing rationale for the big mechanisms (discover-first, fan-out, trimming, write-control, escape hatch) lives in `docs/features.md`; implementation rationale too long for a code comment (Windows rename retry, GET/HEAD body stripping, admin-scope gating) lives in `docs/internals.md`. Keep both in sync when behavior changes — comments stay one-line and point there.

## Project shape

- `src/index.ts` — entry. `buildRegistry()` registers every enabled service (the curated `SERVICES` table plus `GENERATED_SERVICES`, gates in `src/services.ts`, all filtered by `GOOGLE_TOOLSETS`), fails fast if `registry.services()` is empty (BEFORE meta tools register — escape tools would mask an empty service set), then `registerDiscoverTools()` + `registerEscapeTools()` + `registerAccountTools()`; `main()` installs the registry's custom `tools/list` handler and runs the stdio MCP server, or the `auth` / `migrate-tokens` / `config check` CLI commands.
- `src/registry.ts` — `ToolRegistry` wraps the MCP server: records `{name, service, cud, description, inputShape, meta}` per tool, derives `cud` (read/create/update/delete) from the tool name via `inferCud`, **enforces write-control** by wrapping every CUD handler, injects computed annotations (`readOnlyHint`/`destructiveHint`), and owns **discover-first visibility**: all tools register eagerly (always callable — graceful dispatch), but the custom `tools/list` handler advertises per `GOOGLE_DISCOVERY` mode (`lazy` default = meta + `reveal()`ed services, exact v5; `curated` = + all curated; `eager` = everything; `generated` provenance on ToolEntry from the explicit-cud marker). `discover_all`/`discover_reset` metas toggle a runtime lazy→curated overlay (`expand()`/`collapse()`, both fire `tools/list_changed`; collapse also clears reveals — BV-8: a client mishandling a shrinking list degrades collapse to a session no-op, zero correctness impact). `installListHandler()` must run after registration, before connect. Service files still call `server.registerTool(...)` — `server` is now a `ToolRegistry`.
- `src/discover.ts` — `registerDiscoverTools()`: one eager `{service}_discover` meta-tool per service; returns the catalog (`registry.catalog`), reveals the service, triggers `tools/list_changed`. Never emit `tool_reference` content blocks or top-level `defer_loading` fields — strict SDK clients reject/strip them (verified against SDK 1.29; the constraint is client-side and outlived the v2 port).
- `src/toolsets.ts` — `GOOGLE_TOOLSETS` parsing (`all` | CSV of service names).
- `src/discovery-client.ts` — runtime Google API Discovery: `loadMethodIndex(api)` fetches `https://www.googleapis.com/discovery/v1/apis/{id}/{version}/rest` on demand, disk-caches 7 days (`DISCOVERY_CACHE_PATH`), stale-if-offline; `cudFromMethod` (HTTP verb → cud, POST read-verbs like batchGet → read), `expandPath` ({param} + {+param} templates), `searchMethods`. Deps injectable for tests — never hit the network in unit tests.
- `src/tools/google-api.ts` — `registerEscapeTools()`: eager `google_api_search` + `google_api_call`. The call tool enforces write-control ITSELF (its registry cud is read, so the wrapper doesn't gate it) via `isAllowed` on the method's derived cud — keep that check when touching this file.
- `src/fanout.ts` — cross-account fan-out: `parseAccountSelector` (`"*"` | CSV | single), `runFanout` (bounded 5, per-account isolation, merged `{results, partial}` envelope with parsed payloads — never embed raw JSON strings), `fanoutAccountField` (union schema: enum+`*` | CSV regex). Wired in `registry.ts`: read tools only, never meta (`google_api_call` infers cud=read but executes writes), never `FANOUT_EXCLUDE` (read tools that write local files). Fan-out wraps the raw handler INNERMOST so compaction runs once on the merged envelope.
- `src/tools/accounts-tool.ts` — eager `account_list` meta tool + `deriveAccountHealth` (pure, deps-injectable). Reads the token store directly — NEVER `getClient` (would attach refresh listeners). `readToken` throws on decrypt failure (only returns null when missing) — keep the per-account try/catch. Never output token values.
- `src/trim.ts` — response trimming: `compactResult` (registry re-serializes every JSON text output compactly; `GOOGLE_TRIM=off` opts out — compaction only, never the caps), `capText` (paging caps with truncated/totalChars), `sliceClean` (permanent caps — drops a trailing lone surrogate). Fat readers own their caps: `drive_read` `maxChars`/`offset`, gmail reads 50k body cap + `full` param, `calendar_list_events` AND `calendar_list_instances` list-mode `formatEvent(e, {full:false})`. New fat-payload tools should reuse these helpers.
- `src/write-control.ts` — `resolvePolicy()` (env → policy) + `isAllowed()` (deny-by-default verdict) + `config check` rendering.
- `src/token-store.ts` — encrypted token store (AES-256-GCM, key from `MASTER_KEY`); `readToken`/`writeToken`/`updateToken` plus in-memory overlay after hosted refresh persist. The `migrate-tokens` CLI lives in `src/migrate-tokens.ts`. Desk→SM remint: `src/token-secret.ts` (`upload-sm` / `auth --upload-sm`); hosted refresh: `persistRotatedTokenUpdates`; prove harness `src/token-secret-prove.ts`.
- `src/auth.ts` — OAuth flow + per-account scope resolution: each account's `scopeProfile` (from the AccountSet) selects bundles from the catalog; `getOptionalBundles()` returns the UNION across accounts (drives service registration), authz stays per-account; legacy `GOOGLE_OPTIONAL_SCOPES` acts as an implicit global profile (warns). `src/scope-catalog.ts` — the ONE bundle catalog (scopes + description + risk + workspaceOnly; keys are frozen public API, renames via BUNDLE_ALIASES only); unknown bundle names fail E_UNKNOWN_BUNDLE with a did-you-mean hint. Hosted mode refuses provider remint. `--upload-sm` is fail-closed: remint is incomplete until Secret Manager `google-mcp-token-<alias>` gets a new version.
- `src/client.ts` — `getClient(account)`: fresh OAuth2Client per call from the encrypted token (overlay first); grant-gated via `assertAccountAllowed`; wraps `refreshTokenNoCache` so rotation persist is awaited (`persistRotatedTokenUpdates`).
- `src/accounts.ts` — `resolveAccounts()` builds the `AccountSet` (registry): whole-registry env override via `GOOGLE_ACCOUNTS`, else `config.json`; `getAccountSet()` is the live accessor (dispatch-time readers use it, never a captured snapshot); `invalidateAccountSet()`/`isAccountSetStale()` back the reload path. Token dir defaults to `~/.config/mcp-google-multi/tokens` (override `TOKEN_STORE_PATH`).
- `src/config-file.ts` — `config.json` zod-strict schema (secrets-shaped keys fail), version gate, `mutateConfigFile` read-latest-under-lock writer. `src/fs-atomic.ts` — path-keyed hardlink lock + atomic write (generalized from the token store; token writes delegate to it).
- `src/identity.ts` — `buildIdentityContext()`: the frozen forward-compat seam `{subject:'owner', accounts, policy, getClient, tokenStore}`; `buildRegistry(server, ctx)` consumes it. Exactly one context in the free core.
- `src/migrate-config.ts` — `migrate-config` CLI: env -> `config.json` accounts (idempotent, never edits env).
- `src/http.ts` — house Streamable HTTP for Cloud Run / Grok (`buildGoogleMcpServer` per request, Host/Origin, Bearer/JWT `gname`). Not bakissation `src/http-transport.ts`, which `index.ts` still starts only when `MCP_TRANSPORT` includes http. The Cloud Run image runs `dist/http.js`.
- `src/tools/_errors.ts` — `mapGoogleError` typed taxonomy + `handleGoogleApiError` result wrapper; each service file defines its own `handle<Service>Error` shim over it (optionally with a service-specific 403 hint).
- `src/tools/_coerce.ts` — `coerceArray`/`coerceJson`/`coerceBoolean` for string-encoded client args.
- `src/scope-observability.ts` — the #114 three-state classifier (callable / requestable_not_granted / not_requestable{add_bundle|account_type|unknown_scope}): joins a method's required scopes (escape hatch: runtime Discovery; generated tools: baked+interned at gen time on `ApiMethodRef.scopes`) against the account's GRANTED token scopes, enriches `insufficient_scope` hints with copy-pasteable remediation and an honest `retriable`. `account_list`'s scopes block is the compact profile∪granted report; the registered-tool universe is doctor's (B9).

## Adding a tool

```ts
import { <service> as <service>Client } from '@googleapis/<service>';

server.registerTool(
  'service_action_name',                 // snake_case, service-prefixed; cud inferred from the verb
  {
    description: '<one sentence; when to use it>',
    inputSchema: {
      account: accountEnum.describe('Google account alias'),   // always first
      // wrap array/object/bool params with coerceArray / coerceJson / coerceBoolean
    },
  },
  async ({ account, /* … */ }) => {
    try {
      const auth = await getClientFn(account as Account);   // deps.getClientFn ?? getClient
      const svc = <service>Client({ version: '<v>', auth });
      const res = await svc.<resource>.<method>({ /* … */ });
      return { content: [{ type: 'text' as const, text: JSON.stringify(res.data, null, 2) }] };
    } catch (error: any) {
      return handle<Service>Error(error, account as Account);
    }
  },
);
```

**Hard rules:**
- Flat `zod` `inputSchema`; `account` first and now OPTIONAL everywhere (sole exception: `drive_transfer` takes `fromAccount`/`toAccount`) — the registry injects the configured default at ONE dispatch site (before write-control and the fan-out parse; not meta-skipped, which is what covers `google_api_call`); omission with no default returns `E_NO_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT`. Coerce array/object/bool inputs — clients send them string-encoded.
- `cud` is inferred from the tool name (no manual flag). CUD tools are auto-gated by write-control; **never** add your own write gate. Fix a misclassified verb in `CUD_OVERRIDES` (`registry.ts`). Two sanctioned exceptions self-check via `isAllowed`: `google_api_call` (per-method cud) and `drive_transfer`'s `move` flag (delete inside a create-classified tool, checked against `registry.policy`).
- Wrap handlers in try/catch → `handle<Service>Error` (→ `mapGoogleError`); errors return `{error, message, hint?, retriable, account}` with `isError: true`. **Never embed the raw error / `error.config` / `error.response`** — token-leak.
- Return `{ content: [{ type: 'text', text: JSON.stringify(...) }] }`.
- Resolve everything through the registry's context: `getClientFn` from the injected `CuratedToolDeps`, account emails from `server.accountSet()`. **Never** read `getAccountSet()`, the token-store module functions or the bare `getClient` from a handler: a registry built over another context would silently use the owner's. A tool that touches the server's disk registers only when `deps.localFiles` allows it.

## Adding a service

1. `src/tools/<service>.ts` exporting `register<Service>Tools(server: ToolRegistry)`.
2. Scopes in `auth.ts`: always-on → `BASE_SCOPES` (breaking — forces re-auth → `feat!:`); optional → `OPTIONAL_SCOPE_BUNDLES`; admin → `ADMIN_SCOPES`.
3. Add a `ServiceEntry` to `SERVICES` (`src/services.ts`), with an `enabled()` gate for optional bundles — `buildRegistry()` picks it up.
4. Run `npm run gen:coverage` to regenerate `COVERAGE.md` (never hand-edit it), and update the tool/service counts in `README.md` and `docs/features.md`.

## Generated tools (Layer 2)

- `src/tools/generated/*.ts` are EMITTED by `npm run gen:tools` from the `discovery/` snapshot (`npm run gen:discovery` refreshes it) — **never hand-edit**; change `scripts/gen-config.ts` (curated skip-list, NAME/CUD/DESCRIPTION overrides) and regenerate.
- When a new curated tool covers a Discovery method, append the methodId to `CURATED_METHOD_IDS` and regenerate so the generated duplicate disappears; the generator fails the build on name collisions with curated tools.
- Generated tools pass an explicit `cud` (derived from HTTP semantics) through the registry config — the only sanctioned use of `config.cud`; curated tools keep name-verb inference.
- They dispatch through `executeApiMethod` (`src/executor.ts`) with method metadata baked at gen time; the escape hatch shares the same executor (no runtime discovery fetch for generated tools).
- A new generated-only service needs: a `GEN_APIS` entry, an optional-scope bundle in `auth.ts` + `GENERATED_GATES` entry in `services.ts` (or ungated when it authorizes via already-granted resource scopes), and a `WORKSPACE_APIS` alias for escape-hatch/policy parity.
- `npm run gen:coverage` regenerates COVERAGE.md from the registry — run it whenever the tool surface changes.

## Auth / tokens

- Tokens are **encrypted at rest** — never write plaintext. `MASTER_KEY` resolves ONLY through `resolveMasterKey()` in `src/master-key.ts` (env > keychain > 0600 file > generate; hard guard: never generate while `<alias>.enc` exist). Never read the env var directly, never log key bytes (provenance label only).
- Always go through the injected `getClientFn(account)` (handles refresh + re-encrypt). Token files are `0600`.
- Secret-injection patterns (why `MASTER_KEY` shouldn't live in `.env` long-term): `docs/secrets.md`.

## Write-control

Reads are never gated. CUD is **deny-by-default**: `GOOGLE_PROFILE` (read-only / safe-writes / full-writes) + `GOOGLE_READ_ONLY` + `GOOGLE_WRITE_ALLOW`/`DENY` globs. Verdict + precedence in `write-control.ts`, tested in `tests/write-control.test.ts`. User-facing env reference: `docs/configuration.md`.

`safe-writes` is not "cud != delete": `privilegeOf()` also refuses privileged-scope writes (admin/Vault/reseller/script) and `*_watch` push registration, derived from the method's declared scopes and name so it survives regeneration. Pass `scopes` on the `ToolRef` at any new `isAllowed` call site, or the gate silently sees an unprivileged tool. `denyReason()` reports WHICH rule refused (readOnly > deny > allow > profile) and the hint is built from it, so never hand-write a hint that lists settings the verdict did not use.

## Email compose (gmail_send / gmail_create_draft)

Both route through `composeRaw()` in `gmail-mime.ts` (nodemailer MailComposer): header/RFC-2047/address encoding and boundaries are the library's job. A pre-check rejects CR/LF in `from`/`to`/`cc`/`subject` (`E_HEADER_INJECTION`). `attachments` are read by THIS server into buffers (`disableFileAccess`/`disableUrlAccess` on MailComposer), absolute-path-only, basename-guarded, ~35 MB total cap. Do NOT reintroduce hand-rolled header encoders (they were the injection surface, removed in A4).

## Drive specifics

- Every `fileId` call: `supportsAllDrives: true`; lists: `includeItemsFromAllDrives: true`.
- `drive_upload` `convertTo`: resource mimeType = target `application/vnd.google-apps.*`, media = source. `drive_export` is the reverse.
- Comment text field is `content`. Comments/Replies API requires `fields` on every call (see `*_FIELDS` constants in `drive.ts`).

## Sheets/Docs field masks

`batchUpdate` Request types need explicit `fields` masks — compute from input keys, never wildcards. Helpers `buildCellFormat` / `buildParagraphStyle` / `buildDocumentStyle` are unit-tested in `tests/field-mask-helpers.test.ts`.

## Versioning & releases (automated — CI controls it)

- semantic-release on push to `dev` (alpha) / `staging` (beta) / `main` (stable). Never bump `package.json`, write a changelog, or tag by hand.
- Conventional Commits: `fix:`=patch, `feat:`=minor, a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer=major. The analyzer's default (angular) preset does NOT parse a bare `feat!:` — a breaking commit MUST carry the footer or it releases nothing. A new `BASE_SCOPES` scope is breaking.
- **Merge commits only** (squash/rebase disabled) — each branch's commits land individually, so keep them clean Conventional Commits.
- After a release, `.github/workflows/backmerge.yml` resyncs the source branch forward: stable = `main → staging + dev`, beta = `staging → dev`. Never start new work on `dev` until the post-promotion backmerge has merged.

## Testing

- `npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run test && npm run build` before any PR.
- Unit-test pure logic (write-control verdict, coercion, error mapper, token-store crypto, `inferCud`, field-mask builders). Don't mock the `@googleapis/*` clients — smoke-test handlers against real accounts.

## Don'ts

- No `console.log` from handlers, and nothing may write to stdout at import time either — stdio is the MCP channel (the dotenv v17 banner corrupted it, which is why env loading is the native `process.loadEnvFile` in `src/env-load.ts`; guarded by `tests/stdout-purity.test.ts`). `process.stderr.write` only.
- Don't hardcode aliases — read `ACCOUNTS` / `ACCOUNT_CONFIG`.
- Don't bypass `getClient`; don't write plaintext tokens or perms wider than `0o600`.
- Don't re-implement error mapping or write gating — use the shared helpers.
- Don't add narrative comments — non-obvious WHY only.
